# Progressive Web application

Beyond an administration interface, the application will deal with module configuration and when [installed on a mobile device](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android?hl=en) will act as a module itself.

You do not actually need to build or deploy the application itself. You simply need to visit this [link](http://smarthome.surge.sh) and the application will operate within your [locally running hub](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/hub). However if you do want to run the application locally then follow the steps below.

## Setup [TODO]
