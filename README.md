# Smart Home
The goal of the smart home project is a cheap and simplistic solution for creating a system of interconnected smart devices. The project is split into several sections, for more details on each, visit their respective section. The project is pretty big which is why it is separated into several sub-projects. I do not currently have the time to further work on the project, but I do hope to come back to it in the future. Anyone interested in the project is more than welcome to take over.

## Sections

[Modules](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/modules) will do anything from monitor the quality of the air to automatically feed your pets while you are away. 

The [hub](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/hub) facilitates communications between these modules and the outside world. 

The [mobile application](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/mobile) deals with module configuration, system interfacing, and acts as a module itself.

Lastly the [web application](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/web) will act as an administration / commander center for the entire system. 

## Demonstration [TODO]
