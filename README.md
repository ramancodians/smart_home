# Smart Home
The goal of the smart home project is a cheap and simplistic solution for creating a system of interconnected smart devices. The project is split into several sections, for more details on each, visit their respective section. 

### Modules will do anything from monitor the quality of the air to automatically feed your pets while you are away. 

### The hub facilitates communications between these devices and the outside world. 

### The mobile application deals with module configuration, system interfacing, and acts as a module itself.

### Lastly the web application will act as an administration / commander center for the entire system. 

## Demonstration [TODO]
