# Smart Home
The goal of the smart home project is a cheap and simplistic solution for creating a system of interconnected smart devices. The project is split into several sections, for more details on each, visit their respective section. 

[Modules](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/modules) will do anything from monitor the quality of the air to automatically feed your pets while you are away. 

The [hub](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/hub) facilitates communications between these modules and the outside world. 

The [mobile application](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/mobile) deals with module configuration, system interfacing, and acts as a module itself.

Lastly the [web application](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/web) will act as an administration / commander center for the entire system. 

## Demonstration [TODO]
