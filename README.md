# Smart Home
The goal of the smart home project is a cheap and simplistic solution for creating a system of interconnected smart devices. The project is split into several sections as it is quite large, for more details on each, visit their respective directory. I do not currently have the time to further work on the project, but I do hope to come back to it in the future. Anyone interested in the project is more than welcome to take over.

## Sections

[Modules](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/modules) will do anything from monitor the quality of the air to automatically feed your pets while you are away.

The [hub](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/hub) facilitates communications between modules and users.

The [progressive web application](https://github.com/Introvertuous/smart_home/tree/master/pwa) will act as an administration interface for the entire system.

## Demonstration [TODO]
