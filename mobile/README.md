# Mobile App
The mobile app is a react native application. I will publish the application on app stores in the future but for the time being you will need to build and deploy yourself. To do so, download 'mobile' directory and [deploy](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) directly on your device. Note that the app only works with android at the moment as I have not properly configured the ios side yet.
