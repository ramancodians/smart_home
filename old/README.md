# OLD HUB

This is the hub that I had originally wrote which includes a web interface to the entire system. Currently it is a bit of a mess but includes some interesting things that I will eventually work on improving and implementing in the future.

# OLD MODULES

Originally a different script was written for each module. It is likely the case that for complex modules this will be the only way.
